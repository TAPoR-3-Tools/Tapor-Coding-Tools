    "\n",
    "CSV is short hand for comma-separated values. It is a common data structure that can be imported into software such as Mircosoft EXCEL. Although the name implies that each data entry is seperated with a comma that is not always the case. It is possible to sperate values by: comma, tabs, space, etc. Therefore it is important to be aware how your CSV or someone else's CSV is structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the following are all valid forms for a CSV file:\n",
    "   * Jan-01-18, green, 10, good, comments\n",
    "   * Jan-01-18 green 10 good comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically in a CSV file each entry takes up 1 line. Therefore if you have 100 data entry there will be 100 lines in the file.\n",
