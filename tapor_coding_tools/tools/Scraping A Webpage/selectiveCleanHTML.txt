<p> Web scraping ,  web harvesting , or  web data extraction  is  data scraping  used for  extracting data  from  websites .<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Boeing2016JPER_1-0"> [1] </sup> Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the  Hypertext Transfer Protocol , or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a  bot  or  web crawler . It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local  database  or spreadsheet, for later  retrieval  or  analysis .
</p> 
<p>Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Boeing2016JPER_1-1"> [1] </sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"> [2] </sup> Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when you view the page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be  parsed , searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and phone numbers, or companies and their URLs, to a list (contact scraping).
</p> 
<p>Web scraping is used for  contact scraping , and as a component of applications used for  web indexing ,  web mining  and  data mining , online price change monitoring and  price comparison , product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring,  website change detection , research, tracking online presence and reputation,  web mashup  and, web data integration.
</p> 
<p> Web pages  are built using text-based mark-up languages ( HTML  and  XHTML ), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form.  However, most web pages are designed for human  end-users  and not for ease of automated use. Because of this, tool kits that scrape web content were created. A web scraper is an  Application Programming Interface  (API) to extract data from a web site. Companies like  Amazon AWS  and  Google  provide web scraping tools, services and public data available free of cost to end users.
</p> 
<p>Newer forms of web scraping involve listening to data feeds from web servers.  For example,  JSON  is commonly used as a transport storage mechanism between the client and the web server.
</p> 
<p>There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, there are web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in   DOM  parsing,  computer vision  and  natural language processing  to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.
</p> 
<p>Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the  semantic web  vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and  human-computer interactions . Current web scraping solutions range from the ad-hoc, requiring human effort, to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into structured information, with limitations.
</p> 
<p>Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human’s manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.
</p> 
<p>A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX  grep  command or  regular expression -matching facilities of programming languages (for instance  Perl  or  Python ).
</p> 
<p> Static  and  dynamic web pages  can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using  socket programming .
</p> 
<p>Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content and translates it into a relational form, is called a  wrapper . Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"> [3] </sup> Moreover, some  semi-structured data  query languages, such as  XQuery  and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.
</p> 
<p>By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the  Internet Explorer  or the  Mozilla  browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages.
</p> 
<p>There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of “bots” for specific verticals with no "man in the loop" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the  Long Tail  of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.
</p> 
<p>The pages being scraped may embrace  metadata  or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as  Microformat  does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"> [4] </sup> are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.
</p> 
<p>There are efforts using  machine learning  and  computer vision  that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"> [5] </sup>
</p> 
<p>There are many software tools available that can be used to customize web-scraping solutions. This software may attempt to automatically recognize the data structure of a page or provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write web-scraping code, or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform content, and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases. Some web scraping software can also be used to extract data from an API directly.
</p> 
<p>These can be used to build web scrapers.
</p> 
<p>The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the  terms of use  of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"> [6] </sup>
</p> 
<p>In the United States, website owners can use three major  legal claims  to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  (“CFAA”), and (3)  trespass to chattel .<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"> [7] </sup> However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in  Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service  that duplication of facts is allowable.
</p> 
<p>U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of "scrapers" or "robots" may be held liable for committing  trespass to chattels ,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"> [8] </sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"> [9] </sup> which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, <i> eBay v. Bidder's Edge </i>, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as  auction sniping . However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to  chattels , the  plaintiff  must demonstrate that the  defendant  intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"> [10] </sup>
</p> 
<p>One of the first major tests of  screen scraping  involved  American Airlines  (AA), and a firm called FareChase.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"> [11] </sup> AA successfully obtained an  injunction  from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"> [12] </sup>
</p> 
<p> Southwest Airlines  has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of "Computer Fraud and Abuse" and has led to "Damage and Loss" and "Unauthorized Access" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes "Interference with Business Relations", "Trespass", and "Harmful Access by Computer". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as "Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law in this case should be  US Copyright law , and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the  Supreme Court of the United States , FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company  Yahoo! , and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-impervawp2011_13-0"> [13] </sup>
In 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in <i> Craigslist v. 3Taps </i>. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .
</p> 
<p>Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled, and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner’s system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"> [14] </sup>
</p> 
<p>While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site. In a 2010 ruling in the <i> Cvent, Inc.  v.  Eventbrite, Inc. </i> In the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users' attention In order for a  browse wrap  contract or license to be enforced.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"> [15] </sup> In a 2014, filed in the  United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"> [16] </sup> e-commerce site  QVC  objected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly’s `scraping of QVC’s site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly “excessively crawled” QVC’s retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC’s website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC's site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"> [17] </sup> QVC's complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly.
</p> 
<p>In the plaintiff's web site during the period of this trial the terms of use link is displayed among all the links of the site, at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet. This ruling contradicts the Irish ruling described below. The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the browse wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of Virginia's adoption of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)—a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse wrap contracting practices.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"> [18] </sup>
</p> 
<p>In <i> Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc. </i>, a district court ruled in 2012 that Power Ventures could not scrape Facebook pages on behalf of a Facebook user. The case is on appeal, and the  Electronic Frontier Foundation  filed a brief in 2015 asking that it be overturned.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"> [19] </sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"> [20] </sup> In <i> Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc. </i>, a court in the US held Meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the Associated Press, but a court in the United Kingdom held in favor of Meltwater.

<p>Internet Archive collects and distributes significant number of publicly available webpages without it is considered to be copyright violation.
</p> 
<p>In February 2006, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court (Copenhagen) ruled that systematic crawling, indexing, and deep linking by portal site ofir.dk of estate site Home.dk does not conflict with Danish law or the database directive of the European Union.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"> [21] </sup>
</p> 
<p>In a February 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction, Ireland's High Court delivered a verdict that illustrates the  inchoate  state of developing case law. In the case of <i>Ryanair Ltd v Billigfluege.de GmbH</i>, Ireland's High Court ruled  Ryanair's  "click-wrap" agreement to be legally binding. In contrast to the findings of the United States District Court Eastern District of Virginia and those of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court, Justice Michael Hanna ruled that the hyperlink to Ryanair's terms and conditions was plainly visible, and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship.
